# iMMPY

This GitHub page contains the ilastik Mother Machine Python (iMMPY) code and protocol. Here is a guide to the files stored on this page:




    - iMMPY_Protocol.docx is a microsoft word file that contains the step-by-step protocol detailing the steps
         from raw data to output.
         
    - iMMPY_Script_User.py is the python code required to analyse and extract data from ilastik masks. 
    
    - Example_Data contains example data and masks if users want to try out the iMMPY protocol. 
    
         It includes original experimental images, as well as a set of files already processed and ready to be input to the iMMPY script 
        
         Please note that this image data is derived from a failed experiment. I will be updated with
         higher quality images once the project from which these were sourced has been published.
