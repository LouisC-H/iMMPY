# iMMPY
ilastik Mother Machine Python protocol




    - iMMPY_Protocol.docx is amicrosoft word file that contains the step-by-step protocol detailing the steps
         from raw data to output.
    - iMMPY_Script_User.py is the python code required to analyse and extract data from ilastik masks.  
    - Example_Data contains example data and masks if users want to try out the iMMPY protocol. 
         It includes original experimental images, as well as a set of files already processed and ready to be input to the iMMPY script 
        
         Please note that this image data is derived from a low-quality failed experiment. I will be updated with
         higher quality images once the project from which these were sourced has been published.
